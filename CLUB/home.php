                <p><h3>History of EWU</h3>The idea of establishing a private university to provide quality education at an affordable cost in Bangladesh was first mooted by a group of prominent academics, 
                    business leaders, professionals and education enthusiasts led by Dr. Mohammed Farashuddin. With this end in view, this group formed a non-profit, non-political,
                     charitable organization called Progoti Foundation for Education and Development (PFED). East West University is its first major project. Members of the Board of 
                     Trustees of the University are: Mr. Jalaluddin Ahmed, Mr. S.M. Nousher Ali, Mr. Farooque B. Chaudhury, Dr. Rafiqul Huda Chaudhury, Mr. Syed Manzur Elahi,

                      permission by the Government under the Private University Act (Act 34) of 1992, East West University was launched in 1996. Classes started in September 1996
